OpenMW
======

OpenMW is an open-source open-world RPG game engine that supports playing Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks. You need to own the game for OpenMW to play Morrowind.

OpenMW also comes with OpenMW-CS, a replacement for Bethesda's Construction Set.

PS Vita Port
------------

Full port of OpenMW to PS Vita via [vitaGL](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaGL). Runs Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon at 15–30 FPS at 640x368 render resolution (upscaled to native 960x544) with controller input, front touchscreen cursor, and a dynamic fog system that auto-scales draw distance to hold target framerate. Ships with the Morrowind Optimization Patch and Project Atlas baked in for better out-of-the-box performance, plus a dynamic memory-management layer (heap defrag, texture-quality tier-down, cell-demotion under pressure) tuned to the Vita's 357 MB user-RAM budget.

AI Usage: AI Assisted (Dependency/Build system detangling, other odds ends and analysis.)

### Installation

- Install `openmw.vpk` on your Vita using VitaShell
- Copy your Morrowind game data to `ux0:data/openmw/Data Files/`:
  - `Morrowind.esm`, `Morrowind.bsa`
  - `Tribunal.esm`, `Tribunal.bsa` (if GOTY)
  - `Bloodmoon.esm`, `Bloodmoon.bsa` (if GOTY)
  - `meshes/`, `textures/`, `sound/`, `music/`, `fonts/`, `splash/`, `video/`, etc.

- Copy your Morrowind.ini `ux0:data/openmw/`:
- Launch from the home screen (first boot is slow while shaders compile)

- Note to Mac OS users. 
  - Double check your file transfers dont auto add an '_' to the beginning of a file name.
  - If they do please delete that file or you will have errors on boot

### Vita Settings

A dedicated Vita tab is available under Options in the game menu:

- Dynamic Fog — auto-shrinks draw distance to hold target FPS
- Dynamic Fog Target FPS — 15 (max distance), 18 (long), or 20 (balanced)
- Dynamic Fog Aggression — Normal, Aggressive, or Very Aggressive (how hard fog reacts to FPS dips)
- View Distance — manual draw distance when dynamic fog is off
- Field of View
- Font Size
- Preload Cell Cache — 1 (default) or 2 (smoother cell transitions, more RAM)
- Render Resolution — 480x272 / 512x288 / 640x368 (default). Higher = sharper but heavier on the GPU. Restart required.
- Texture Detail — Performance / Balanced (default) / High / Off. Caps the max texture edge size at load time. Lower settings reduce VRAM and improve cell-load speed. Restart required. Engine also auto-clamps to a lower tier under sustained memory pressure to avoid OOMs.

### Bundled Optimization Mods

The VPK ships with [Morrowind Optimization Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384) and [Project Atlas](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399) pre-baked as read-only BSAs at `app0:/resources/baked-mods/`. They're auto-detected at boot and load on top of vanilla Morrowind, but BELOW any user mods in `ux0:data/openmw/mods/` — so you can still override individual baked files with your own. No action needed to enable them.

**Credits — these mods are the work of the upstream mod authors, not this port. Full attribution shipped at `app0:/resources/baked-mods/credits/` and reproduced here.**

- **Morrowind Optimization Patch**: the MOP authors. See `MOP-Contributors.txt` inside the VPK for the full list.
- **Project Atlas**: Project Atlas Team — FloorBelow, Greatness7, Lord Berandas, Melchior Dahrk, MwGek, Petethegoat, Pop000100, R-Zero, Remiros, revenorror, RubberMan, Sataniel, Stuporstar, vtastek, Wollibeebee. See `Project-Atlas-README.md` inside the VPK for full notes.
- Atlas asset workflow uses tooling built on **Blender Foundation** technology.

Both mods are distributed under their original Nexus license terms — please see the linked Nexus pages for details. If you use this port to play, consider giving them an endorsement.

### Mods

Drop full mod folders into `ux0:data/openmw/mods/<name>/`. Plugin files (`.esm`, `.esp`, `.omwaddon`, `.omwscripts`) and `.bsa` archives inside are auto-detected and added to the load order on next boot. Loose meshes/textures can also go directly under `Data Files/`. Saves live in `ux0:data/openmw/saves/` and are interchangeable with PC OpenMW saves.

### Notes

- Video plays without audio
- Shadows, post-processing, water shaders, distant terrain, and groundcover are disabled for performance
- Water and Video tabs are removed from Settings
- Text input fields (character name, custom class name, spell name, enchantment name, class description, console) open the Vita IME automatically when the dialog opens, and tapping a name field also re-opens it
- Memory: heap is bumped to 312 MB via ATTRIBUTE2 extra-memory mode, with a periodic cache flush, automatic heap-defragmentation pass, and dynamic texture-quality tier-down under sustained pressure. If you still hit OOMs, lower Texture Detail or Render Resolution in the Vita tab

### Building for Vita

Requires the [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/) toolchain. Docker is easiest:

```bash
$ sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.vita -t openmw-vita .
$ sudo docker create --name openmw-vita-build openmw-vita
$ sudo docker cp openmw-vita-build:/src/build-vita/apps/openmw/openmw.vpk .
```

Or manually:

```bash
$ ./scripts/vita-deps/build-all.sh
$ mkdir build-vita && cd build-vita
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/VitaToolchain.cmake ..
$ make -j$(nproc) openmw.vpk-vpk
```

The build automatically bakes [Morrowind Optimization Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384) and [Project Atlas](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399) into the VPK as BSA archives if their extracted folders are present under `<repo>/mods/`. If the `mods/` folder is missing the bake step silently no-ops and produces a vanilla VPK. Set `-DOPENMW_VITA_BAKE_MODS=OFF` to disable explicitly.

Current Status
--------------

The main quests in Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon are all completable. Some issues with side quests are to be expected (but rare). Check the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/?milestone_title=openmw-1.0) for a list of issues we need to resolve before the "1.0" release. Even before the "1.0" release, however, OpenMW boasts some new [features](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Features), such as improved graphics and user interfaces.

Pre-existing modifications created for the original Morrowind engine can be hit-and-miss. The OpenMW script compiler performs more thorough error-checking than Morrowind does, meaning that a mod created for Morrowind may not necessarily run in OpenMW. Some mods also rely on quirky behaviour or engine bugs in order to work. We are considering such compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis - in some cases adding a workaround to OpenMW may be feasible, in other cases fixing the mod will be the only option. If you know of any mods that work or don't work, feel free to add them to the [Mod status](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Mod_status) wiki page.

The data path
-------------

The data path tells OpenMW where to find your Morrowind files. If you run the launcher, OpenMW should be able to pick up the location of these files on its own, if both Morrowind and OpenMW are installed properly (installing Morrowind under WINE is considered a proper install).
